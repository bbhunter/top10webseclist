Abstract
—Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are the
most frequently reported web application vulnerability. As com-
plex JavaScript applications become more widespread, DOM
(Document Object Model) XSS vulnerabilities—a type of XSS
vulnerability where the vulnerability is located in client-side
JavaScript, rather than server-side code—are becoming more
common. As the rst contribution of this work, we empirically
assess the impact of DOM XSS on the web using a browser with
taint tracking embedded in the JavaScript engine. Building on
the methodology used in a previous study that crawled popular
websites, we collect a current dataset of potential DOM XSS
vulnerabilities. We improve on the methodology for conrming
XSS vulnerabilities, and using this improved methodology, we
nd 83% more vulnerabilities than previous methodology applied
to the same dataset. As a second contribution, we identify the
causes of and discuss how to prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
One example of our ndings is that custom HTML templating
designs—a design pattern that could prevent DOM XSS vul-
nerabilities analogous to parameterized SQL—can be buggy in
practice, allowing DOM XSS attacks. As our third contribution,
we evaluate the error rates of three static-analysis tools to detect
DOM XSS vulnerabilities found with dynamic analysis techniques
using in-the-wild examples. We nd static-analysis tools to miss
90% of bugs found by our dynamic analysis, though some tools
can have very few false positives and at the same time nd
vulnerabilities not found using the dynamic analysis.
I. I
NTRODUCTION
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most frequently reported
class of web-application vulnerabilities, constituting 25% of
web vulnerabilities reported in 2014 [9]. By compromising
client-side browser security using XSS, attackers can gain con-
trol over login cookies, passwords, and authentication tokens,
and perform application-level actions as users, for example,
send emails or make nancial transactions [25]. Preventing
XSS typically requires website owners to not only sanitize all
untrusted inputs to their web application, but also to sanitize
all input that could be received by the client's JavaScript
interpreter—a task that can be error-prone due to the complex-
ity of web applications and the widespread use of sensitive
functions in JavaScript. Document Object Model cross-site
scripting (DOM XSS)—a particular type of XSS vulnerability
that occurs entirely in client-side JavaScript—is more and more
of a threat as JavaScript on the web becomes increasingly
complicated. Traditional methods for defending against XSS
vulnerabilities in server-side code—for example, server-side
taint tracking or web application rewalls—typically do not
apply because the vulnerability lies entirely in client code and
servers may not even have logs to detect when an attack occurs.
In this paper, we aim to answer the following questions
about DOM XSS. Are DOM XSS vulnerabilities becoming
more or less common? How do state-of-the-art methods for
detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities compare? Are web de-
velopers learning to avoid such vulnerabilities through good
coding practices, for example, using encoding schemes or
design patterns such as HTML templating? What are the causes
of DOM XSS? Do shared libraries or web-content-generation
frameworks propagate DOM XSS vulnerabilities across a large
number of sites?
To answer these questions, we use a dynamic approach
to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities on the Internet. Prior
work showed how to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities using
taint tracking to track ows of attacker-controllable infor-
mation sources to sensitive sink functions (e.g.,
eval
and
document.write
) [8], [22]. The existence of such ows
only indicates that data from a source can reach a sink, but
does not account for whether the data has been sanitized by
the programmer. Thus, once a ow with a potential DOM XSS
vulnerability is observed, the ow must be conrmed to be
exploitable. In this paper, we show how to more accurately
detect whether a ow that is potentially vulnerable is capable
of being exploited. Although an attacker can use several
types of sources (e.g., cross-origin messages and cookies), we
focus, similarly to prior work [22], on conrming ows from
URL-based sources. These are of particular interest because,
compared to other ows, they are easy for attackers to exploit.
We used this methodology to detect DOM XSS vulnerabil-
ities on Internet. We crawled the homepages and ve random
subpages of websites on the Alexa Top 10,000 most popular
websites list [11]. Compared to previous work [22], we ob-
served both more ows per web page and determined a higher
proportion of those ows to be vulnerable, even when using the
same methodology as previous work to determine which ows
are vulnerable. Using our improved method for determining
which ows are vulnerable, we found 83% more vulnerabilities
than by using prior methodology [22]. We believe this indicates
that DOM XSS vulnerabilities are becoming more common in
the four years since the previous study was undertaken.
In addition, we qualitatively examined the code paths that
led to the vulnerabilities. We observed, for example, that most
of the vulnerabilities did not share code, implying that the
vulnerabilities we found are due to custom code, rather than

the inclusion of buggy shared libraries. We also observed
errors in the implementation of HTML templating that allowed
XSS vulnerabilities. Templating can be an effective way to
prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities, and is similar to using
parameterized SQL queries. We found cases where bespoke
templated HTML designs failed to properly encode template
values, which attackers could then inject code into.
Finally, using our collected dataset of DOM XSS vulner-
abilities, we evaluated static-analysis tools that are designed
to detect DOM XSS. In the past, researchers have com-
pared the effectiveness of vulnerability scanners on synthetic
datasets [16], [36], whereas we used real-world vulnerabili-
ties. We found that static-analysis tools performed poorly at
detecting the vulnerabilities found by the dynamic analysis.
However, some static tools were shown to have low false-
negative rates and at the same time identify DOM XSS issues
not found by the dynamic analysis, suggesting that dynamic
analyses and static analyses are nding qualitatively different
types of vulnerabilities. Our ndings on static-analysis tools
suggest that testing using both dynamic and static approaches
may be necessary to secure web applications from DOM XSS.
In summary, our contributions are as follows.

We improve the methodology to conrm DOM XSS vul-
nerabilities, and nd that 83% more detected ows are
vulnerable than suggested by prior work [22].

We empirically analyze the prevalence of and causes behind
DOM XSS vulnerabilities. This yields a number of insights
for example, that HTML templating is error prone to im-
plement and that DOM XSS vulnerabilities are becoming
more prevalent. We also provide guidance for preventing
DOM XSS vulnerabilities.

We compare static-analysis tools that detect DOM XSS vul-
nerabilities, nding them to detect different vulnerabilities
than our dynamic analysis.

We develop a modied version of Chromium for tracking
the taint information of strings, which we are releasing as
open source.

Next, in Section II, we provide background on DOM
XSS vulnerabilities and compare our work to prior work for
detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities. Then, in Section III, we
detail our methodology for crawling the Internet for DOM XSS
vulnerabilities, and our improved technique for conrming po-
tentially vulnerable ows. In Section IV we describe the results
of our experiments for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities and
evaluating static-analysis tools for detecting DOM XSS. We
describe the limitations of our work in Section V. We discuss
the implications of our ndings in Section VI, and conclude
in Section VII.

ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Here, we cover background and prior work relevant to
DOM XSS vulnerabilities. First, we give examples of and
general background on DOM XSS vulnerabilities in Sec-
tion II-A. Then, in Section II-B, we give examples of general
XSS defense mechanisms and why those mechanisms fail to
adequately apply to DOM XSS. In Section II-C, we cover1

work that discusses the impact of previously discovered vul-
nerabilities. Next, we describe prior work on detecting DOM
XSS vulnerabilities using taint tracking in Section II-D. We
describe prior work on comparing web-application scanners
in Section II-E. Finally, we describe how static-analysis tools
help prevent DOM XSS in Section II-F.
A. DOM XSS vulnerabilities
Cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are a type of
injection vulnerability in which an attacker can inject arbitrary
code into a running web application to, for example, take
control of the data and credentials used in the application. For
example, attackers may get access to the websites's cookies
(which potentially contain login tokens), or may execute
user actions with respect to the compromised website [25].
In XSS, the injected code is JavaScript that runs in a web
application with the permissions of the compromised website.
Unlike traditional XSS attacks in which an attacker's injection
might be the result of a server-side failure to sanitize input,
DOM XSS is a relatively new type of XSS vulnerability
that occurs purely as a result of JavaScript executing on
the client. Figure 1 shows a example. In the example, an
attacker could craft a link that breaks out of the
href
's single
quoted attribute and inject an arbitrary script; for example,
http://[website]/[page]#"
><
script
>
CODE
<
/script
><
!--
.
This link, when clicked, would execute the attacker-controlled
code (
CODE
). An attacker may convince their victims to
click on the link using social engineering, or may embed
the link in an iframe on a website that the attacker controls.
Like traditional XSS bugs, the details depend heavily on the
website and the victim's browser. Chromium, for example,
does not encode any characters after the `#' symbol, whereas
Firefox encodes such characters using URL encoding. Hence,
it is not uncommon for a specic exploit to work only in
specic browsers [29].
For a DOM XSS vulnerability to be present, there
must be a ow of information from a potentially attacker-
controlled source to a sensitive sink function. Examples
of potentially attacker-controlled sources include: the URL
of the document, accessed via the
document.location
JavaScript object; data passed in cross origin messages us-
ing the
postMessage
API; cookies, accessed via the
document.cookie
object; and the HTTP referrer ac-
cessed by the
document.referrer
JavaScript object
and other methods. Sinks can include any mechanism to
execute arbitrary code, for example: the
eval
function,
document.write
, JavaScript event handlers (e.g., the
2

--- page 3 ---

“onclick” attribute), and URLs that have a JavaScript scheme
(e.g.,
<
a href=javascript:...
>
).
B. Generic XSS defenses
Many methods have been used to mitigate or defend against
XSS vulnerabilities in general but do not apply to DOM
XSS. Server-side taint-tracking and static-analysis techniques
fundamentally cannot be applied for detecting client-side vul-
nerabilities [14], [37]. Content Security Policies (CSPs) also
aim to solve the problem. However, the adoption of CSPs
has been limited and developers frequently miscongure the
policies, allowing unsafe code to execute [15], [38]. Web-
application rewalls attempt to solve the problem by blocking
all requests that match certain patterns (often lists of regular
expressions) that indicate an XSS attack is occurring. However,
web-application rewalls are known to allow many attacks
due to their reliance on simple pattern matching [13], [18].
Furthermore, since DOM XSS exploits might not be sent to
the server, the injection may never be visible to a rewall on
the network. Dynamic taint tracking, a technique to observe the
ows of information throughout a program, has been proposed
as a run-time defense against DOM XSS attacks [34]; however,
it requires large infrastructure changes to web browsers. Addi-
tionally, taint tracking at run time can decrease performance.
The effect of such dynamic instrumentation on performance
can potentially be small; however, it often has high variability,
where a handful of websites have a serious performance
decrease [23]. In contrast, our work uses taint tracking to
detect vulnerabilities, rather than defending against attacks at
run time.
C. Studying the impact of known vulnerabilities
Prior research has studied the impact of known vulner-
abilities on websites. Researchers found that in 2017, 37%
of websites included at least one version of a library with a
known vulnerability [21]. Researchers in that work measured
the prevalence of websites including old, outdated versions of
72 popular libraries. Other work has found that many websites
include third-party JavaScript that does not take all necessary
security precautions [24]. Our focus differs from these works in
that, rather than studying the prevalence of already known vul-
nerabilities, we detect vulnerabilities without prior knowledge
of them. In addition, our approach goes beyond vulnerabilities
in outdated versions of code in popular libraries and allows us
to discover potentially unknown vulnerabilities.
D. Finding DOM XSS vulnerabilities using taint tracking
The state of the art for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities
is using dynamic taint tracking. This technique marks poten-
tially attacker-controlled sources as “tainted” and propagates
information about tainted values throughout the program. For
example, the taint-tracking engine might mark the concatena-
tion of one tainted piece of information and one untainted as
also tainted. When a tainted string is used in a sensitive sink,
the taint-tracking engine may ag this as a potential DOM
XSS vulnerability.
A variety of tools and research have used dynamic taint
tracking to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities. The DOMinator
tool is a Firefox-based technology that tracks the taint status
of strings in JavaScript [8]. It is the oldest tool to apply
taint tracking to JavaScript. In 2013, Lekies et al. showed
that DOM XSS is prevalent, and introduced a method for
detecting DOM XSS using more precise, byte-level taint
tracking of JavaScript code, also accounting for the built-
in encoding functions used in JavaScript [22]. To generate
automated exploits, the researchers used a context-specic
exploit generation methodology designed to create a workable
exploit by analyzing the context in which the tainted string
occurs in the sink. Their technique was tested by performing a
crawl of the Alexa Top 5,000 websites searching for DOM
XSS vulnerabilities. Their work showed that automatically
generated exploits can be created and that DOM XSS vul-
nerabilities affect 9.6% of domains on the Alexa Top 5,000
websites. Our work uses a similar methodology as Lekies et
al.'s work for identifying tainted ows, but we use a new and
novel method for conrming whether ows are indicative of
DOM XSS vulnerabilities. We describe in detail the similarities
and differences between our methodologies and results in
Sections III and VI.
Other work, building upon a system for detecting DOM
XSS vulnerabilities using browser-agnostic taint tracking [29],
provided a method to track taint information and inject an
extension that sanitizes injected strings at run time just before
those strings are inserted into the sensitive sink functions [28].
The browser-agnostic framework allows detecting vulnerabili-
ties that are specic to certain browsers; however, such vulner-
abilities account for a small fraction of all vulnerabilities [29].
Their work focused on their proposed defense mechanism and
the capability of using a browser agnostic taint tracking, in
contrast to our work which provides a measurement of the
prevalence of DOM XSS vulnerabilities and the ability of
static-analysis tools to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
Researchers have also shown how to use taint tracking to
defend against DOM XSS vulnerabilities at run time [34]. That
work began from a list of known DOM XSS vulnerabilities,
and showed that in 73% of cases, current client-side ltering
technology—the XSS Auditor in webkit-based browsers—fails
to lter an attack. The work proposes the use of browser-based
taint tracking to more precisely prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
However, this requires modication of the browser engine and,
as mentioned earlier, can cause performance degradation. The
researchers conclude that many domains make use of partly-
tainted HTML markup injection, and that blocking all such
cases would not be feasible, instead recommending a specic
heuristic policy to separate safe cases from dangerous cases.
Additionally, prior work quantitatively examined DOM
XSS vulnerabilities [35], nding that while many vulnera-
bilities are of low complexity, some are the result of highly
complex JavaScript interactions. The researchers found that
many DOM XSS bugs are the result of vulnerable third-
party scripts, missing knowledge about browser-provided APIs,
unaware developers, or incompatible rst- and third- party
code. Our ndings about vulnerability complexity and the role
of third-party code are similar; we compare them in detail in
Sections IV-A and IV-C. Differently from previous work, we
also explore the role of advertising domains, the effectiveness
of static-analysis tools, the distribution of vulnerabilities across
and within domains, and design-level prevention mechanisms
such as HTML templating.

E. Web-application scanners
Web-application scanners are commonly used tools to
actively test for a variety of security issues in web applications.
Scanners use different methods to detect security issues, of
which DOM XSS is one. Prior work has surveyed web-
application scanners, nding them to overlook many classes
of vulnerabilities, and to be limited by their ability to crawl
websites; however, that work did not focus on DOM XSS, and
also did not examine web vulnerabilities in the wild, instead
creating a test environment [16]. Other work reports on the
false-positive and false-negative rates of web scanners [36].
That work also tests against a set of manufactured vulnerabil-
ities and not on in-the-wild vulnerabilities and does not focus
specically on DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
F. Static-analysis tools
Static-analysis tools that support JavaScript, such as
ScanJS [12] and JSLint [10], have gained popularity. Those
tools statically, without executing code, attempt to detect com-
mon programming errors in JavaScript, for example, pointing
out the use of dangerous functions or undened variables. In
general, static-analysis tools suffer from more false positives
than dynamic approaches [27], [31]. However, static-analysis
tools are becoming a generally accepted part of the way that
software is developed—passing a static analysis without errors
is a requirement often listed in style guides (e.g., [1], [5]).
In part, this is due to their ability to be run practically and
repeatably with little setup, for example, in nightly builds [27].
Some vulnerability detection tools, like Burp Suite [32], also
have a static-analysis component. However, the degree to
which static-analysis tools can detect and prevent real DOM
XSS vulnerabilities is unknown. In addition, JavaScript as
a programming language has traditionally been difcult to
statically analyze because of its dynamic features (for example,
widespread use of the
eval
function and reliance on dynamic
typing). In this work, we study the ability of static-analysis
tools to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript.
III. M
ETHODOLOGY
Next, we describe the methodology for our experiments
to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities on the Internet. In Sec-
tion III-A, we describe how we crawled websites and which
web pages we visited. In Section III-B, we discuss the specics
of the taint-tracking engine we developed. In Section III-C,
we describe how we conrmed vulnerabilities. Finally, we
detail the methodology for testing static-analysis tools in
Section III-D.
A. Crawling for DOM XSS vulnerabilities
We rst crawled the Internet using a browser instrumented
to perform taint tracking. The browser collected information
about what data ows occurred in the page, and output a
log le detailing the ows and the encoding methods applied.
Then, for a subset of ows, we tested whether the ow was
exploitable by generating example inputs crafted to deliver
a payload to the sensitive sink. This methodology builds on
the methodology used in prior work for detecting DOM XSS
vulnerabilities at scale [22]. We describe the differences from
this prior work in this Section and in Section III-C.
document.write(
'<a href="' + encodeURI(document.location) +
'">Link</a>');Fig. 2: Modied example of Figure 1, in which the code
would have a DOM XSS vulnerability if the encoding function
was not applied. In this example, the
encodeURI
function
encodes the location so that the double-quote character cannot
be injected.
To crawl websites, we started by visiting the Alexa Top
10,000 websites, a list of the globally most popular web-
sites [11]. Then, we collected all the links to other web pages
on the home page of each website, and randomly selected ve
web pages that were hosted on the same domain as the original
domain to limit our crawl to a manageable size given our
resource constraints. This crawl is broader, but more shallow,
than Lekies et al.'s [22], and the difference between the two
offers the opportunity for new insights about the incidence
of DOM XSS vulnerabilities (see Section VI-A). We also
obeyed the
robots.txt
directives, which direct automated
programs—robots—as to which pages may be traversed [7].
We automated the process of visiting web pages and extracting
the links on a page by developing and using a browser plugin.
Whenever any web page did not load correctly—for example,
because of a timeout—we attempted to load the same page
three times. If the failed page was not the top-level page
of a domain, we attempted to load a different web page
in the same domain. Crawling occurred during the summer
of 2017, roughly four years after Lekies et al.'s work was
published [22].
B. Dynamic taint analysis
Like prior work [22], we instrumented Chromium to per-
form byte-precise tracking of the provenance of each byte of
strings in JavaScript. We will not focus on the design of our
taint-aware browser because it is not a core contribution of
our work and the design is similar to prior work. We have
released the source code for our modied, taint-aware version
of Chromium and V8, the JavaScript engine used in Chromium
(see https://github.com/wrmelicher/ChromiumTaintTracking).
To summarize the design of the taint-aware browser:
We rst allocated space in each JavaScript string primi-
tive for a one-byte taint value that stores the provenance
of each byte of the string. This allows taint information
to be precisely propagated during string concatenation or
slicing. In addition to the provenance of each string byte,
each bookkeeping byte also records which built-in encod-
ing methods have been applied. For example, using the
encodeURIComponent
JavaScript function will modify
the taint information to reect that the string has been
encoded using the
encodeURIComponent
function. Dur-
ing taint propagation, matching encoding-decoding pairs will
cancel each other. For example, if a string is encoded
using
encodeURIComponent
and later decoded using
decodeURIComponent
, then the string will be identied
as having no encoding applied. The taint information is only
stored for string types and not for arbitrary JavaScript objects.
This prevents tracking across different data types: for example,
4

--- page 5 ---

parsing a string into an integer and then writing the integer to
a string would remove all taint information.
Our browser checks the arguments of sensitive functions
(e.g., the
eval
function or
document.write
; see Ap-
pendix VIII for an exhaustive list) for tainted bytes. If an
argument contains tainted bytes, then a record is written to
a log le describing the ow, including: the type of taint, the
locations of the tainted bytes, the sensitive sink function, and
a stack trace. Afterwards, we analyze the logs to determine
which ows are
potentially
vulnerable to DOM XSS attacks
and which ows are not.
Whether a ow is vulnerable depends on the context of the
injection in the HTML or JavaScript, the encoding functions
that have been applied, and the source and sink types. For
example, if we detect that a tainted value is not encoded and
begins in the context of an HTML double-quoted attribute,
then that ow is potentially vulnerable. However, if the string is
encoded using the
encodeURIComponent
built-in function,
then a double quoted attribute is not vulnerable because the
encodeURIComponent
function encodes the double quote
as “%22”. Figure 2 shows code that would have a DOM XSS
vulnerability if an encoding function was not applied. This
list of potentially vulnerable ows is then tested to decide
whether the ow is actually vulnerable to XSS attacks using
a process we describe in Section III-C. One example of a
potentially vulnerable ow that is not actually vulnerable to
DOM XSS attacks is when the application performs custom
sanitization of inputs that is not detected by the taint-tracking
engine—for example, by halting execution if the input does
not match a certain form that is known to be safe. The log
les also contain the stack trace for the sink call of each ow.
In addition to making the ow more repeatable for post-hoc
manual analysis, this allows us to examine the code path that
led to the vulnerability (see Section IV-A).
C. Attack conrmation
By crawling web pages using the taint-aware browser
described in Section III-B, we generate a list of poten-
tially vulnerable ows. We then simulate an exploit to test
those potentially vulnerable ows to decide whether they
are actually vulnerable. We experimented with two meth-
ods of automatically crafting injections to test: one used
by prior work, which appends the injection to the end
of the string [22]; and a novel method that attempts to
more accurately pinpoint the specic bytes of the string
in which to inject a payload. For the purposes of auto-
matically crafting injections we limited ourselves to URL-
based sources (e.g., the
document.location.href
ob-
ject and derivatives like
document.location.search
,
document.location.hash
, etc.). Those types of poten-
tial vulnerabilities are straightforward to generate potential
exploits for, and therefore can be easily veried to be actual
vulnerabilities. For the same reasons, they are the ows com-
monly targeted by attackers [26].
The rst method (termed method A), used in prior
work [22], appended the exploit to the end of the URL.
The new method (termed method B), which more accurately
pinpoints where in the string to inject the payload, attempts to
insert the exploit into the bytes of the source string that match

the tainted bytes in the sink. An example is shown in Figure 3.
The log les contain the information about which bytes of the
string are tainted and the semantic source label for those bytes
(e.g., from the URL). Therefore, we can infer which bytes of
the source will make their way into the sink by examining
the string that is injected into the sink and comparing it to
the source string. The insight behind this method comes from
the observation that many of the values injected into sinks
are values of parameters provided in the URL. Our method
is designed to capture URL parsing in client-side code. It is
relatively commonplace for JavaScript code to manually parse
query parameters on the client, for example, by parsing the
URL looking for the special characters that signal parameters:
?, &, and =. In this way, the URL is often used to pass
parameters to other links or to control the display of the web
page. While this method of conrming that a ow is vulnerable
is extremely simple, in practice we nd the combination of
both methods to generate 83% more exploits than just the rst
method (method A).
To test candidate exploits purely in the browser, i.e., with-
out affecting the website, we limit our candidate exploits to the
part of the URL string after the hash (the `#' character), as this
segment of the URL string is not sent to the website hosting the
page, but only processed internally by the JavaScript running
in the browser.
We also did not craft actual valid HTML and JavaScript
exploits for attack conrmation, but rather crafted a unique
string that included characters necessary for an exploit (e.g.,
the single quote character if injecting a value into a single
quoted HTML attribute). In our payload, we injected the string
marker<>'"
and then examined our sink injection log les
for this string.
We believe that avoiding the use of valid HTML and
JavaScript in simulated exploits and targeting only the portion
5

--- page 6 ---

of the URL string after the hash—beyond limiting risk to web
servers—leads to simulated exploits that are both easier to
generate and less likely to be caught by client or server-side
lters. Such lters are notorious for being easily bypassable
by humans [13], [18]. However, for an automated injection,
we wanted our approach to scale to many websites and
detect when an exploit could likely be crafted, instead of
being ltered by an easily bypassable defense mechanism. To
conrm that a ow was vulnerable to DOM XSS attacks, we
searched the logs for the unique injection string in the output.
To conrm that our methodology did not yield false positives,
we randomly sampled 40 ows that our process agged as
vulnerable and manually developed a working exploit. We
found that all 40 instances were vulnerable; therefore, we
believe that the vast majority of cases found by our automated
method were actual vulnerabilities.
After conrming vulnerabilities, we qualitatively examined
a subset of these vulnerabilities for insights into the root
cases of DOM XSS vulnerabilities. For each vulnerability
that we manually analyzed, a researcher manually reproduced
the vulnerability based on the saved stack trace in our log
les. Then, we distilled the vulnerability to a small amount of
code that could describe the ow of data in the vulnerability.
These code snippets were then analyzed to extract the themes
common to vulnerabilities. We classied vulnerabilities by
complexity and also noted other interesting aspects of the
code that had the vulnerability. Our results for this analysis
are presented in Section IV-C.
D. Static analysis
After we collected a list of conrmed DOM XSS vulner-
abilities, one of the analyses we performed was to evaluate
the effectiveness of static-analysis tools to detect these vulner-
abilities. We sampled our dataset in two ways to create test
sets to evaluate the false-positive rate and the rate with which
the tested static-analysis tools detect these vulnerabilities. First,
we sampled websites that have known vulnerabilities from our
dataset of conrmed DOM XSS vulnerabilities, found using
methodology described in Section III-C. Then, we sampled
from all websites that we visited to measure the false-positive
rate. Note that for measuring the false-positive rate, we sam-
pled from all websites, not only from websites where we did
not detect a vulnerability. We sampled in this way so that our
sampling would not be biased towards sites that might be less
buggy. Sampling from our dataset of known vulnerabilities,
rather than using manufactured vulnerabilities, has the benet
that we are using real-world bugs.
a) Description of static-analysis tools:
We evalu-
ated three tools for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities:
ScanJS [12], esow [4], and the static-analysis tools in Burp
Suite Pro [32]. We also attempted to test jsprime [30], but were
unable to get it to work without crashing. We focused on open-
source or inexpensive proprietary tools that statically detect
DOM XSS vulnerabilities. There are variety of other, more
expensive proprietary vulnerability scanning tools, including:
IBM Security AppScan, Acunetix, Trustwave App Scanner,
Retina web application scanner, Qualys web inspect, HP
Fortify static code analyzer, and Coverity's JavaScript scanner.
However, for our application of scanning a large number of
domains, these were prohibitively expensive. Prior work has
compared a wide variety of these proprietary tools for general
purpose vulnerability detection (i.e., not restricted to DOM
XSS vulnerabilities), and found them to have comparable error
rates to each other [36].
The static-analysis tools that we chose appear to have
different tradeoffs. ScanJS is a tool meant to help people
avoid coding practices that lead to, among other things, DOM
XSS vulnerabilities. As such, it ags code that could be
unsafe without aiming to identify whether the code leads to
an exploitable bug. For example, it may point out all locations
where the
document.write
function was used with a non-
static string as an argument. While this is a good practice
to avoid, it is not always indicative of a vulnerability. In
fact, the majority of cases are benign. Burp Suite attaches a
condence rating to each potential vulnerability that it ags,
giving guidance about which ndings are most reliable. Burp
Suite also receives code from the website by acting as a
proxy between the browser and the website, meaning that
it has access to code that is dynamically loaded (e.g., by
a
<
script
>
tag added during execution) unlike the other
tools; however, it still is not able to analyze code that is
dynamically
generated
(e.g., by using the
eval
function).
Esow is unique in that it often attaches source and sink
information to its issue reports for easier debugging.
IV. R
ESULTS
We used the taint-tracking and crawling methodology de-
scribed in Section III to collect a dataset of tainted ows. We
visited 44,722 web pages, which had in total 319,481 frames.
One would expect that trying to visit ve subpages on each
domain, we would have visited 60,000 web pages: 10,000 top
level pages and 50,000 subpages. However, we skipped loading
1,761 web pages due to
robots.txt
directives; and we were
unable to load 4,094 web pages after three attempts due to
timeouts, 462 because Chromium would not load the page
(most often due to SSL warnings), and 26 because Chromium
crashed when rendering them. Some of the pages unable to be
loaded were top-level pages; in that case we also did not visit
other pages on that domain.
We describe how we detected DOM XSS vulnerabilities
using our dynamic analyses in Section IV-A. Then, in Sec-
tion IV-B, we use the results from our dynamic analysis
to evaluate different static-analysis tools for detecting DOM
XSS vulnerabilities. Finally, in Section IV-C, we describe the
qualitative trends that we observed from manually analyzing a
sample of our dataset.
A. DOM XSS vulnerabilities detected using dynamic analysis
After crawling our set of web pages, we post-processed the
generated taint-tracking logs to generate a list of observed data
ows. Each ow has a source, through which an attacker could
inject code, and a sink, a sensitive function that consumes
data derived from the source of the ow. We tracked ows
that have sources that could be potentially manipulated by an
attacker, and sinks that could potentially execute JavaScript, in-
cluding functions that directly execute JavaScript (e.g.,
eval
),
functions that inject HTML (e.g., assigning to innerHTML or
calling
document.write
), and JavaScript event handlers.
A summary of the sources and sinks that we tracked can be
found in Table I.

Overall, visiting 44,722 pages resulted in 4,140,873 de-
tected ows. We focus on ows with URL sources and HTML
or JavaScript sinks, as these are the most straightforward to
exploit. Consistently with that, research has generally focused
on examining this subset of ows or found it to account for
the majority of exploitable ows (e.g., [22], [29]).
Other ows have preconditions that make automatically
exploiting them more difcult at scale. For example, to exploit
a cookie ow, an attacker must nd a way to manipulate the
victim's cookies; for message ows, an attacker must nd a
potential ow whose code does not check the message origin
and also send the message at the proper time, when the receiver
is expecting it. With the exception of message ows, URL-
based sources account for the largest number of ows to sinks
that can execute arbitrary JavaScript (HTML and JavaScript
sinks). Hence, these are the ows we analyze, and we show
that they lead to many instances of DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
Of the 4,140,873 ows we detected, 285,147 (7%) had a URL-
based source.
a) Conrmed vulnerable ows:
We determine whether
a tainted ow is vulnerable as follows. We rst discard
ows in which the tainted value is encoded using a built-in
encoding method, for example, the
encodeURIComponent
function; we are certain that such ows would ordinarily not

be exploitable. This eliminates 66% of the ows we focus
on (URL sources to JavaScript or HTML sinks). We next
remove from consideration ows that could not be exploited
in Chromium due to Chromium's natural encoding of some
URL variables (for example, Chromium automatically encodes
the content of
document.location.search
to prevent
the occurrence of any character that would not be allowed in
a URL). After removing those types of ows, we determine
which of the remaining 1.33% (54,954 ows) of ows are
actually vulnerable by attempting injections. A summary of the
number of ows removed at each stage compared to previous
work with similar methodology [22] can be seen in Table II.
In our taint-tracking system, we specially mark ows
that have multiple, incompatible encodings with a ag that
represents the use of multiple encodings, but not which specic
encodings or in what order. Such ows accounted for 2% of
ows overall. While we did not attempt to determine whether
these ows were actually vulnerable, there were 716 unique
ows of this type that may have been potentially vulnerable
(i.e., that could have been included in row 6 of Table II). If they
had been included, they would account for 12% of potentially
vulnerable ows.
We used two methods to conrm vulnerabilities—each
described in Section III-C—based on where to insert the
injected payload: inserting the payload at the end of the URL
or inserting the payload into the key-value pair from which
we observed a ow to a sink. We found that 45% of the
conrmed vulnerabilities we detected were due to ows from
key-value pairs, 22% of the vulnerabilities were only the result
of inserting the payload at the end of the source, and 32% of
the vulnerabilities were observed to work with both methods.

Table III shows the breakdown of how many of the 3,219
unique vulnerabilities came from which injection method. Both
methods of injection work in cases where the entire URL
is concatenated with markup (i.e.,
document.location
,
rather than a specic substring, is included in markup). Our
key-value pair injection method identies vulnerabilities that
involve parsing URL parameters, while inserting the injection
at the end identies vulnerabilities in which part of the path
or URL besides the URL parameters is used as part of the
parameter to the sink.
To count unique vulnerabilities, we removed duplicates
using the same method used as Lekies et al. [22]: unique bugs2
Numbers do not add up to 100% due to rounding.
Fig. 4: Distribution of unique vulnerabilities across domains.
The y-axis shows the number of unique vulnerabilities found
on a particular domain in log scale. The x-axis shows domains
sorted by frequency; for example, ten on the axis shows the
domain with the 10th most vulnerabilities. For example, the
domain with the most vulnerabilities had nearly 1,987 unique
vulnerabilities.
are identied by their domain, their location in the script, and
the context (e.g., inside a double-quoted attribute or the name
of an element attribute) of the tainted section of the string
argument to the sensitive sink.
We also computed the number of unique vulnerabilities
across different domains, as shown in Figure 4. We found
that the majority of vulnerabilities come from a handful of
domains, and that many domains had only a few unique
vulnerabilities or one vulnerability: the ten domains with the
most vulnerabilities had in total 2703 unique vulnerabilities;
the remaining 354 domains accounted for the remaining 516
vulnerabilities.
Interestingly, when performing the vulnerability conrma-
tion crawl we observed vulnerabilities in six iframe URLs that
were not previously seen in our rst crawl. These iframe URLs
were part of the conrmation crawl because either they or
the top-level pages that included them had previously been
marked as potentially containing a vulnerability. The difference
in time between collecting data and conrming vulnerabilities
was nine days.
b) Vulnerability attribution by domain and domain cat-
egory:
We next attempted to shed light on the cause of the
vulnerabilities that we observed by examining where they
occurred. Were they due to third-party scripts, old versions
of popular libraries, custom code for each website, or other
causes? For this measurement, we used the URL of the frame
where the vulnerability was found, since this is the context
in which an attacker would be able to execute JavaScript,
rather than using the URL of the top-level frame. We used the
location of the sink as a starting point for determining to which
entity to attribute the vulnerability. In particular, we examined
the distribution of vulnerabilities in three ways: (1) the domain
on the iframe in which the script executed; (2) the domain on
which the script was hosted (web pages often import scripts
from other domains); and (3) the domain of the top-level page
that the user was visiting. Rather than reporting results about
individual domains, we report them by the topic category of the

scale. Script domains are the domains that the vulnerable scripts were hosted on. Frame domains are the domain of the frame

a script URL. This may happen when the sink location is in dynamically generated code.
domains. We use the Blue Coat K9 classication of domains
into topics [2] for this purpose.
We found that the vast majority, 2,645 of 3,219 of our
unique vulnerabilities (82%), were found to execute inside
iframes with domains that were known to serve web advertise-
ments or perform analytics. Other domain types that accounted
for many vulnerabilities included shopping and news.
We also analyzed what type of domains hosted the scripts
in which we found vulnerabilities. Similarly to the above
result, we found that 2,681 of 3,219 vulnerabilities (83%) were
in scripts hosted on advertising and analytics domains. Figure 5
shows the analysis of the types of script domains and website
domains with conrmed vulnerabilities. For this measurement,
we used the domain of the script where the sink function call
was found. While advertising domains were the most popular
source of vulnerable scripts, our data-collection infrastructure
did not capture enough information to similarly categorize
scripts that did not have potentially vulnerable ows. Hence,
while we can report that, in web pages that had at least one
ow, 38% of the time the ow originated in a script that
was categorized as an advertising script, we cannot determine
whether the fraction of advertising-domain scripts that was
vulnerable was greater than the fraction of scripts from other
domain categories.
We matched the unique vulnerabilities that we found with
the top-level web pages that contained those vulnerabilities in
our dataset. Many of the vulnerabilities that we found were on
subframes of other web pages, and we wanted to understand
how much exposure users would have if they visited the top-
level pages in our dataset. Table IV shows the categories of
these top-level web pages. Note that there are signicantly
more data points than unique vulnerabilities because some

vulnerabilities that scripts were found in. The x-axis shows the
rank in log scale of the scripts in a sorted list; for example, 10
shows the script that was 10th most frequently present in stack
traces. The y-axis is the percent of script URLs that were less
than that rank. For example, the rst script was present in the
stack traces of 0.34% (11 of 3,219) unique vulnerabilities.
vulnerabilities were present in web pages that were subframes
of multiple web pages. In contrast to Figure 5, where the most
popular category was web ads and analytics, here the popular
topics are news/media (27.7%) and entertainment (12.9%).
In total, for 282 (8.8%) of the vulnerabilities we found the
domain the script was hosted on was different from the domain
of the iframe in which the script executed. This suggests
that while a non-trivial fraction (8.8%) of vulnerabilities may
be caused by developers relying on third-party scripts, the

vast majority of vulnerabilities are in the developers' own
scripts (or at least scripts hosted locally on their domains). The
fraction is smaller than reported in prior work, which found
that 22% of code attributable purely to an error by a third
party [35]. This difference could be the result of our different
methodology for conrming DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
c) Vulnerability attribution by script:
We additionally
examined the scripts in the entire stack trace for each vulnera-
bility. The goal of this analysis was to determine whether some
scripts occurred in stack traces of vulnerabilities particularly
often. Such scripts could be good candidates for adding
encoding functions, or for other remediation, as that would
prevent many vulnerabilities. At the same time, if some scripts
occur in many stack traces of vulnerabilities, this could indicate
that developers misunderstand how to correctly use that script.
For our 3,219 conrmed vulnerabilities, we identied the
scripts in the stack trace of each vulnerability, and then
counted how many stack traces each script was present in.
For this analysis we removed jQuery from our results because
many websites use various HTML rendering functions (e.g.,
the
html
or
append
jQuery methods) that are working as
intended, but misused by the caller. Hence, we removed any
script name that contained the string “jquery” without respect
to character case.
We found that the majority of vulnerable scripts was
present in only one unique vulnerability stack trace—implying
that the causes of vulnerabilities are unique. Figure 6 shows
the percentage of stack traces that each script is seen in.
d) Vulnerabilities in commonly blocked content:
Inter-
net folklore has often claimed that ad blocking software pro-
tects your computer from XSS vulnerabilities common in ad
networks [19]. Because we found that many of both the target
web pages and the vulnerable scripts were located on domains
that hosted advertising, we tested how much protection a
normal user who uses an ad blocker would have from such
vulnerabilities. For this analysis, we used the adblockparser
Python library [6] to simulate what scripts would not be
executed if the user was running ad blocking software that
obeyed the rules dened in the Adblock EasyList, a popular
rule list of advertising content to block [3]. We counted a
vulnerability as being blocked if the Adblock EasyList would
block either the script or the entire target URL when the target
URL is loaded inside an iframe and not as the main frame. We
found that, of the 3,219 unique vulnerabilities, 2,039 (63%)
would have been blocked by this simulated conguration of
Adblock.
B. Effectiveness of static-analysis tools
We next examine whether the vulnerabilities we found
could be detected at development time using off-the-shelf
static-analysis tools. We nd that most could not, although
static-analysis tools sometimes found additional bugs.
More specically, with our dataset of conrmed vulnerabil-
ities IV-A, we tested static-analysis tools to evaluate their abil-
ity to nd the same vulnerabilities that the dynamic analysis
found. To target JavaScript, dynamic analysis traditionally is
seen as having fewer false positives [27]; however, static analy-
sis is often more helpful for programmers during development
because of the lack of customized analysis for adding new
code—developers can set up a static-analysis toolchain once
to automatically check new code. In addition, static analysis
can be more complete—able to detect vulnerabilities in code
that was not executed on a particular run of the program.
The majority of the vulnerabilities that were caught in our
experiment only by static-analysis tools were in this category.
a) Overlapping vulnerabilities:
We compared the rates
at which different tools, described in Section III-D, found
the vulnerabilities that we had previously compiled using the
dynamic analysis. We found that the tools we tested usually
failed to detect the DOM XSS vulnerabilities from our dataset.

% of detected vulnerabilities # of reported issuesEsow0% 4
ScanJS8% 2700
Burp Suite10% 39TABLE V: The percent of vulnerabilities detected by the
dynamic analysis that were detected by different static-analysis
tools out of a total of 50 web pages with known vulnerabilities.
The full results comparing different tools are provided in
Table V. Notably, while Burp Suite, the most promising tool,
had a low rate of nding the same errors as the dynamic
analysis, it pointed out many potential issues not found by
the dynamic analysis. We next describe these ndings in more
detail.
We randomly sampled 50 of the 3,219 unique bugs we
found using our dynamic analysis. Then, for the two tools
that scanned JavaScript code, we downloaded the web page
where the vulnerability was located, and all the accompanying
JavaScript, and used the downloaded JavaScript as input to
the tools. We included any JavaScript embedded in HTML
in addition to externally loaded JavaScript. Because the tool
was examining the web page statically, we were not able
to include JavaScript that is dynamically loaded during the
execution of the page. For Burp Suite, we loaded the web page
in the Chromium web browser and connected Burp Suite to the
browser via a proxy. In this way, all the JavaScript requested
by the browser was analyzed by Burp Suite's static-analysis
tool. Therefore, it was able to access external scripts that were
dynamically loaded during execution.
We counted a tool as successfully identing one of these
vulnerabilities if it output any error message related to DOM
XSS referring to the code where the sink for the vulnerability
was located. For Burp Suite and esow, we manually reviewed
all messages and counted how many referred to the exact line
number and character offset of the sink that was vulnerable.
For ScanJS, we counted messages that referred to the same
script location (line number and script name) as the vulnerable
sink, provided that they warned of a potential XSS vulnerabil-
ity. We explicitly terminated the analysis of any program that
took longer than one hour. This affected four of the 50 web
pages tested with esow. In practice, we believe that this is
realistic in that static-analysis tools must give results within a
reasonable time to be useful to developers. We do not count
as matches cases in which the tool detects a vulnerability that
was not a part of our dataset.
b) False positive rates:
We compared the false positive
rates of the tools by sampling tool output and manually
deciding whether the particular snippets of code that the tool
agged could be exploitable. We found Burp Suite to have no
false positives, while the other tools had many false positives.
Table VI shows the results for all tools.
We randomly sampled 50 out of all the URLs that we
visited in our dataset. We randomly sampled from all URLs,
and not just URLs for which we did not conrm vulnerabilities,
so that our results for false positive rates would not be biased
towards websites that are more secure, and therefore more
likely to have false positives than true positives. We thenTool False positive % # of reported issuesEsow 95% 19

analyzed the scripts on those pages with each of the tested
static-analysis tools. Each tool would report ndings on the
pages related to DOM XSs. We randomly sampled 20 of those
ndings, except for esow, which only reported 19 ndings.
We then manually examined each nding, and the piece of
code that it referred to, to determine whether that piece of
code could be exploitable. In doing so we aimed to simulate
how a developer assessing the same code and reviewing the
output of the tool would categorize the bug.
Our guiding criteria for manually counting true and false
positives in the tools' output was to look for ows from
exploitable sources (e.g., URLs, cross-origin messages) to
exploitable sinks (e.g.,
document.write
,
eval
) without
encoding that would render the ow benign. Thus, we counted
ows as true positives even if the identied block of code was
not executed during the page load during which our dynamic
analysis detected a vulnerability. This may happen because the
function is dead code, or because that particular page load did
not happen to execute the vulnerable function. We believe this
method of measuring false positives is a conservative estimate,
because in reality some of the identied vulnerabilities may be
in dead code. We also did not include ndings that were not
related to DOM XSS vulnerabilities—for example, warnings
about bad coding practices—as either false positives or false
negatives. We aimed to measure the number of actionable
vulnerabilities that could be detected by our tested static-
analysis tools.
Deciding whether a “bug” reported by a static-analysis tool
is exploitable was a judgment call. We believe that any bias in
the judgment is likely to be biased towards marking something
as non-exploitable when it could be exploited, because it is
easier to show how a piece of code might be dangerous,
but much harder to conrm that code is safe in all cases.
In practice, we believe this closely matches how an engineer
reading the output of such a tool would label the output.
C. Qualitative trends in DOM XSS vulnerabilities
To gain greater insight into the causes that give rise to
DOM XSS vulnerabilities, we manually, qualitatively analyzed
two subsets of the vulnerabilities detected by our dynamic
analysis. First, we randomly selected from the unique vulner-
abilities; however, we noticed that a large portion of these
vulnerabilities was semantically very similar, despite being
unique bugs according to our uniqueness criteria (script lo-
cation, hosting domain, and context; also used in previous
work [22]). Therefore, we also selected a separate subsample
of vulnerabilities, in which we rst randomly selected 20
domains on which vulnerabilities had been found, and then
selected a random vulnerability on each domain. This allowed
us to get a sample that is conceptually more representative
11

--- page 15 ---

of the types of bugs that occur across different domains,
and hence of the types of problems that are likely to be
encountered by different organizations. A summary of the
trends we observed is located in Table VII.
a) Vulnerability complexity:
First, we found that some
bugs were extremely simple, such as concatenating the entire
URL into an HTML or JavaScript execution function. Exam-
ples of why this happened were creating a form where the
form submission attached a return URL for the current page,
or passing the web page's URL as a query parameter for the
source of an iframe. In addition to simple concatenation, we
also found cases where the URL was stored in a non-local
variable that could be assigned to in code that was far away
from the sink (e.g., in a different le or function).
b) Failed mitigation behaviors:
In addition, for eight
of the forty vulnerabilities the relevant code was more com-
plex and spanned multiple functions. Three of those eight
utilized custom template processing that did not perform
encoding based on the context in the template, resulting
in insecure templating code. Another vulnerability was due
to an attempt to perform custom, but highly incomplete,
ltering—removing all instances of
<
script
>
tags, but still
leaving open many other ways for an exploit to occur, for
example, by using event handler code like
<
img src=x
onerror=
INJECTION
/
>
. For two other vulnerabilities,
code involved in the ow was dynamically generated using the
eval
function, meaning that such code would typically not
be visible to static-analysis tools.
We did not observe any failed attempts to use custom
encoding functions. Combined with the fact that many of the
bugs were shallow—a nding echoed by [35]—this suggests
that perhaps engineers were not aware that URLs could contain
characters that could be used to inject markup.
When manually reproducing vulnerabilities, we also ob-
served cases where complex control-ow paths must be fol-
lowed to execute the vulnerable piece of code. For example, we
could not reproduce one specic vulnerability until realizing
that the vulnerable code was only executed if the screen width
was larger than 1,024 pixels, as it had been in our original data
collection. In another case, the vulnerable section of code was
executed on some page loads but not on others. We discuss
code coverage further in Section VI.
V. L
IMITATIONS
Despite being less straightforward to automatically exploit
in the context of a live website, other types of ows besides
the ones we focused on (URL to HTML and JavaScript ows)
may also be vulnerable. For example, we observed (during
manual analysis) a ow from a cookie source to an HTML
sink that could be exploitable by a second ow from a URL
source into a cookie sink on the same web page. The page
could be exploited by crafting a special URL, from which
content would ow through the document's cookie into the
HTML sink. Other work has observed XSS vulnerabilities
that derive from cookie sources and could be exploitable by
web attackers [39]. Vulnerabilities that exploit the JavaScript
postMessage
API have also been reported [33]. Location
sinks can be leveraged to create more potent phishing websites,
in which an attacker may craft a URL that points to theBy domain By unique bugSimple concatenation 8 1

observed during qualitative coding of bugs. We randomly
sampled our vulnerability dataset in two ways, by domain
and by unique vulnerabilities; each sample contained a total
of 20 vulnerabilities. “Simple concatenation” refers to bugs
that were a simple concatenation of the entire source with
HTML or JavaScript markup. “Multiple functions” refers to
vulnerabilities that spanned multiple functions. “Simple except
for variable usage” refers to bugs where a variable with the
source value was concatenated with HTML or JavaScript code.

target website but is redirected to a phishing website via
assignment to
document.location
in JavaScript. A victim
might assume that they were on a benign website because the
hostname in the URL they clicked on was benign. We speculate
that these other types of ows might be similar to the types of
ows we study here and would be a good avenue for future
work.
We sampled only a subset of the web pages on the Internet,
and on the pages we sampled, we did not exercise much
dynamic functionality—for example, by clicking on web-
page elements or entering text—nor were we able to visit
web pages behind log-in barriers. On one hand, this allowed
our analysis to scale to large numbers of vulnerabilities and
websites, but on the other, the vulnerabilities we detected may
not be representative of all vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, we
found many vulnerabilities through our analyses. Our manual
analysis of vulnerabilities may also exhibit similar biases: We
performed a more in-depth analysis only of a subset of our
results. This subset was by necessity small so that it would
be feasible to manually analyze. We do not suggest that the
examined vulnerabilities are representative of our dataset, but
we analyzed them in depth to give greater insight into at least
some vulnerabilities.
Due to slight differences in methodology, the comparison
of our results to previous work may not be perfectly accu-
rate. Differences in results may be due to implementation
differences, although for the parts of methodology that are
shared between our work and Lekies et al.'s [22], we tried to
reproduce previous methodology faithfully.
VI. D
ISCUSSION
We performed this study to measure the prevalence of
DOM XSS vulnerabilities, evaluate and inform the design of
static-analysis tools, and assess the viability of other methods
for preventing DOM XSS vulnerabilities. We rst discuss
12

--- page 16 ---

how the raw results of our measurement study compare to
previous work that used similar methodology to measure XSS
vulnerabilities (Section VI-A), teasing out which differences
are the result of methodology and which reect a change in
the prevalence of DOM XSS vulnerabilities. We then leverage
our quantitative and qualitative analyses of the sources and
nature of DOM XSS vulnerabilities to discuss the weaknesses
of some suggested countermeasures (Section VI-B). Finally,
we further interpret the results of our examination of static-
analysis tools and suggest how these tools could be improved
to catch more DOM XSS vulnerabilities (Section VI-C).
A. Comparing measurements on DOM XSS vulnerabilities
Our methodology for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities
replicates and builds on Lekies et al.'s [22]. We extend Lekies
et al.'s methodology by adding another method for determining
whether a bug is exploitable, namely, inserting a potential
exploit into query key-value pairs rather than just at the end of
the URL. When inserting the injection at the end of the URL,
we nd that a roughly similar fraction of ows is vulnerable as
reported by Lekies et al. [22]. However, using both methods
of inserting the injection, we identify 83% more conrmed
vulnerabilities than when just inserting the exploit at the end.
This suggests that previous work, as well as our own, may
substantially undercount the number of vulnerable ows.
Our methodology differed from that of Lekies et al., in
that we visited twice as many top-level domains, but fewer
subpages for each domain (see Section III-A). We believe
this is the main cause of different ndings for the number
of domains that have at least one vulnerability. Previous work
found 9.6% of domains to have at least one vulnerability, while
we found 3.8% of domains to have one. Interesting, this shows
that vulnerabilities are not systemic, i.e., a domain that has at
least one vulnerability is not likely to have that vulnerability
(or different ones) on a preponderance of pages. Since some
parts of pages hosted on the same domain are often shared
across most pages, this implies that DOM XSS vulnerabilities
are usually not in this shared content.
Where our methodology and that of Lekies et al. are
most directly comparable—when relying only on the simpler
method of conrming vulnerabilities and examining the ra-
tio of vulnerabilities to number tainted ows or to number
of pages visited—our results are generally similar, although
overall our results suggest an increase in the number of
vulnerabilities over time. In our work, we nd more ows
per page—on average, 92.6 ows per page compared to
an average of 48.5 ows per page in Lekies et al.'s work.
Additionally, normalizing by the number of ows we found
more vulnerabilities: We found 0.04% of ows to be vulner-
able, while Lekies et al. reported 0.03%. Normalizing by the
number of pages visited, we also found more vulnerabilities:
1,754 vulnerabilities on 44,722 pages (3.9%); previous work
found 6,167 vulnerabilities on 504,275 web pages (1.2%). We
speculate that this difference is because JavaScript programs
are becoming more complex, and as a consequence DOM XSS
vulnerabilities are becoming more frequent.
B. Preventing DOM XSS
In Section IV-A, we showed that the unique vulnerabilities
typically did not involve many of the same scripts: the stack
traces of the exploits of different vulnerabilities were generally
composed of different scripts. We interpret this to mean that
most DOM XSS vulnerabilities are due to custom code, and
not library code that is shared by many domains.
One way to prevent DOM XSS vulnerabilities is to detect
them before the software is released. We believe that a promis-
ing direction for nding DOM XSS vulnerabilities at scale is
using techniques that analyze larger portions of the program
space. The problem of code coverage of dynamic analysis
techniques is not new or specic to DOM XSS vulnerabilities;
however, it can be a bigger hurdle for large-scale analysis of
web applications than for traditional programs. Running many
versions of a web application may require a large amount of
network bandwidth for reloading web pages, which can make
it difcult to scale. Solutions that avoid reloading the page to
explore more sections of the program should be explored, as
well as methods to force execution down alternate program
paths. In particular, work on fuzzing parameters for traditional
XSS [17] and on forcing JavaScript execution through different
code paths [20] holds promise.
Our analysis also provides additional evidence of the risks
of developing custom versions of common design patterns.
While using design patterns for templated HTML—a prac-
tice analogous to parameterized SQL queries—is generally a
good approach to preventing DOM XSS vulnerabilities, it is
important to correctly implement the details. For example,
we observed three instances of bespoke HTML template
implementations that did not apply encoding functions to
the values of the templates. In general, custom templating
implementations can be error prone, because differences in
context can be easy to overlook. For example, to be safe from
XSS, a value in a templated HTML statement that is inside
a script tag must rst have encoding applied for the HTML
parser and then for the JavaScript parser.
C. Static-analysis tools
We next further interpret the results of running the static-
analysis tools on a sample of vulnerable scripts (see Sec-
tion IV-B). These results suggest that many vulnerabilities may
currently escape both static and dynamic analyses. We also
leverage our results to suggest ways to extend static-analysis
tools to catch more bugs.
In Section IV-B, we measured the false positive rate of
different static-analysis tools and the rate at which tools
correctly identied vulnerabilities from our dataset of known
vulnerabilities using dynamic taint tracking. For the false
positive rate, we empirically sampled the tools output and
manually decided whether a tool's nding was a false positive
or a true positive. However, we were unable to empirically
measure the false negative rate overall. This is because it was
not feasible for us to know all possible vulnerabilities in non-
contrived application. Instead, we measure the rate at which
static-analysis tools can detect known bugs that are detected
with a different methodology.
Our analysis of Burp Suite, the best-performing static-
analysis tool we tested, showed low false-positive rates but also
an inability to detect most of the vulnerabilities identied by
the dynamic analysis. Together, these two measurements imply
that the static-analysis tools were detecting largely different
13

--- page 17 ---

vulnerabilities that our analysis. The dataset of vulnerabilities
with which we tested static-analysis tools, however, was lim-
ited to vulnerabilities detected through our dynamic analysis.
In our test, we visited a large number of web pages but did not
attempt to exercise much of the web application's functionality,
for example, by clicking on elds, entering data into forms,
or sending messages to pages. It is likely that such activities
would reveal more vulnerabilities. In addition, in our dataset,
we found many of the vulnerabilities to be shallow, in that they
involved a straightforward concatenation of data from a source
into the parameter to a sensitive sink function. This is similar
to prior ndings [35]. Indeed, it could be that the majority of
vulnerabilities are more complex and would be better detected
by static-analysis tools. Given that we know that there are
many bugs that escape either analysis, we speculate that there
may be many more bugs that escape both analyses.
ScanJS generally appears to identify poor coding practices
that lead to DOM XSS vulnerabilities, rather than detecting
such vulnerabilities. Indeed, many of the suggestions that
the tool gives revolve around the use of certain functions
being dangerous (e.g.,
document.write
or
eval
). While
ScanJS unfortunately did not detect many vulnerabilities on
our dataset, we believe it to be useful for, e.g., enforcing coding
standards.
Based on our experiments, we can make some recommen-
dations for improving static-analysis tools. One area where
static-analysis tools could improve is the ability to track ows
across function boundaries. We found a non-negligible number
of such vulnerabilities (20% in the domain sampling setting
in Section IV-C) and tracking such ows can be difcult
statically, especially when there are many branches. Another
aspect of static-analysis tools that could use improvement is
the ability to track ows that go through objects. For example,
a tainted string is sometimes stored as the key or value in a
JavaScript object and later used in a computation. Finally, one
constraint of static-analysis tools that is especially limiting in
JavaScript is the inability to analyze dynamically generated
code. A hybrid static-analysis tool that analyzes new code
before it is executed in the browser might be better able to
detect such vulnerabilities.
VII. C
ONCLUSION
We studied how to detect and prevent DOM XSS vulner-
abilities in JavaScript code. In this work, we improved on
the methodology to conrm DOM XSS vulnerabilities, nding
83% more vulnerabilities than by using previous methodology
applied to the same dataset. We used our methodology for
detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities to empirically measure
the prevalence of DOM XSS vulnerabilities on the Internet,
nding them to be more common now than when previously
measured in 2013. With our collected dataset of DOM XSS
vulnerabilities, we also compared the ability of static-analysis
tools to detect the same bugs that dynamic analysis techniques
found, nding static-analysis tools to detect different types
of bugs, with little overlap. A summary of our ndings can
be found in Figure 7. We are in the process of notifying the
website owners of the vulnerabilities we discovered.Measurement
Our key-value pair injection method in conjunc-
tion with prior method found 83% more vulner-
abilities than found using only prior method of
injection [22].
Sec. IV-A

We identied what has changed and what remains
the same in DOM XSS over a 4-year span by
building on top of a prior experiment.
Sec. VI-A
XSS trends
We found more tainted ows overall and a higher
rate of vulnerable ows than previous work, which
suggests that DOM XSS is getting worse.
Sec. VI-A

Vulnerabilities are concentrated on a small num-
ber of iframe owners and script hosting sites.
Sec. IV-A

83% of vulnerabilities are due to code hosted on
advertising and analytics domains.

What contributes to XSS
DOM XSS vulnerabilities are likely not systemic
within domains.
Sec. VI-A

Vulnerabilities are often in unique, custom code,
not in shared libraries.

Incorrectly implemented bespoke HTML templat-
ing, a defense against XSS, introduces XSS vul-
nerabilities.

XSS prevention
Ad blocking would block many of the vulnerabil-
ities and is an effective client-side protection tool.
Sec. IV-A

Incorrectly implemented templating leads to vul-
nerabilities and possibly false sense of security.
Sec. VI-B

The three popular (low-cost or free) static-analysis
tools we tested are not effective at nding the
vulnerabilities found using our dynamic tool; how-
ever, Burp often nds vulnerabilities not found by
our tool.
