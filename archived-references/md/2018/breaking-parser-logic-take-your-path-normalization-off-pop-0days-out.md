title: "Breaking Parser Logic: Take Your Path Normalization Off and Pop 0days Out"
description: Servers, frameworks and reverse proxies normalise URL paths differently, so a segment such as /..;/ or an encoded traversal is read one way by the front proxy and another by the Java backend. The mismatch bypasses proxy ACLs and context mapping to reach management consoles and chain into remote code execution, and produced 0days in Spring, Rails, Spark and Jenkins.

Agenda

1. The blind side of path normalization
2. In-depth review of existing implementations
3. New multi-layered architecture attack surface

--- page 4 ---

Normalize

To make standard; determine the value by comparison to an item of known standard value

--- page 5 ---

Why normalization?

To protect something

--- page 6 ---

Inconsistency

```
if (check(data)) {
    use(data)
}
```

--- page 7 ---

[Diagram: a single line of code with two brackets annotating different spans of the string]

```
new URL("file:///etc/passwd?/../../Windows/win.ini")
```

Windows treat as UNC — bracket spanning `?/../../Windows/win.ini` (from just after `passwd` to the end of the string)

Linux treat as URL — bracket spanning `file:///etc/passwd`

--- page 8 ---

Polyglot URL path

- Rely on getPath() under Windows

```
URL base = new URL("file:///C:/Windows/temp/");
URL url  = new URL(base, "file?/../../win.ini");
```

- Rely on normalization of getFile() or toExternalForm() under Linux

```
URL base = new URL("file:///tmp/");
URL url  = new URL(base, "../etc/passwd?/../../tmp/file");
```

--- page 9 ---

Why path normalization

- Most website handle files(and apply lots of security mechanism)
- Lack of overall security review
  - Code change too fast, does the patch and protection still work?

Can you spot the vulnerability?

```
static String QUOTED_FILE_SEPARATOR = Pattern.quote(File.separator)
static String DIRECTIVE_FILE_SEPARATOR = '/'

public AssetFile getAsset(String relativePath) {
    if(!relativePath)
        return null
    relativePath = relativePath.replace( QUOTED_FILE_SEPARATOR,
                                         DIRECTIVE_FILE_SEPARATOR)
```

--- page 13 ---

replace v.s. replaceAll

```
String replace(String target, String replacement)
String replaceAll(String regex, String replacement)
```

--- page 14 ---

Can you spot the vulnerability?

```
static String QUOTED_FILE_SEPARATOR = Pattern.quote(File.separator)
```

```
Pattern.quote("/") = "\Q/\E"
```

```
relativePath = relativePath.replace( QUOTED_FILE_SEPARATOR,
                                     DIRECTIVE_FILE_SEPARATOR)
```

How single slash could be failed?

--- page 18 ---

Nginx off-by-slash fail

- First shown in the end of 2016 HCTF - credit to @iaklis
  - A good attack vector but very few people know
  - Nginx says this is not their problem

- Nginx alias directive
  - Defines a replacement for the specified location

--- page 19 ---

Nginx off-by-slash fail

```
http://127.0.0.1/static../settings.py
```

[Diagram: a red arrow points from `static` in the URL above down to `/static` in the location directive below]

```
location /static {
   alias /home/app/static/;
}
```

Nginx matches the rule and appends the remainder to destination

```
/home/app/static/../settings.py
```

--- page 20 ---

How to find this problem?

Rails 0day - CVE-2018-3760

1. Sprockets supports `file://` scheme that bypassed `absolute_path?`
2. URL decode bypassed double slashes normalization
3. Method `split_file_uri` resolved URI and `unescape` again
   - Lead to double encoding and bypass `forbidden_request?` and prefix check

Misconfiguration to auth bypass

- Automatic scaling up but seems to forget the password file
  - About 16% chance to meet the misconfigured server(3~4 in 25)
  - To make things worse, there is the CAPTCHA in login process
  - We must be lucky to poke the same server on both CAPTCHA and login process

Railo, the CFML engine - free, open source and easy to use. This Web Administrator is provided in order to customize your web context.

There is no Java Agent defined in this enviroment. The Java Agent is needed to improve memory (PermGen Space) consumption for templates. To enable the Java Agent follow this instructions:

  - Add the "-javaagent" JVM argument and set it to point to the railo-inst.jar in your lib directory
    in this environment that would be: -javaagent:/usr/local/railo/railo-inst.jar

Amazon RCE case study

- Remote Code Execution on Amazon Collaborate System
- Found the site `collaborate-corp.amazon.com`
  - Running an open source project `Nuxeo`
  - Chained several bugs and features to RCE

--- page 67 ---

Path normalization bug leads to ACL bypass

How does ACL fetch current request page?

```java
protected static String getRequestedPage(HttpServletRequest httpRequest) {
    String requestURI = httpRequest.getRequestURI();
    String context = httpRequest.getContextPath() + '/';
    String requestedPage = requestURI.substring(context.length());
    int i = requestedPage.indexOf(';');
    return i == -1 ? requestedPage : requestedPage.substring(0, i);
}
```

--- page 68 ---

Path normalization bug leads to ACL bypass

The path processing in ACL control is inconsistent with servlet container so that we can bypass the whitelist

[Table: three columns — URL, ACL, Container]

```
URL                    ACL       Container
/login;foo             /login    /login
/login;foo/bar;quz     /login    /login/bar
/login;/..;/admin      /login    /login/../admin
```

--- page 69 ---

Code reuse bug leads to Expression Language injection

- Most pages return `NullPointerException` :(
- Nuxeo maps `*.xhtml` to Seam Framework
- We found Seam exposed numerous Hacker-Friendly features by reading source code

--- page 70 ---

Seam Feature

```
http://127.0.0.1/home.xhtml?actionMethod:/foo.xhtml:utils.escape(...)
```

If there is a `foo.xhtml` under servlet context you can execute the partial EL with certain format by `actionMethod`

[Diagram: a document icon labeled foo.xhtml containing the code below]

```
foo.xhtml
"#{util.escape(...)}"
```

--- page 71 ---

To make thing worse, Seam will evaluate again if the returned string looks like an EL

```
http://127.0.0.1/home.xhtml?actionMethod:/foo.xhtml:utils.escape(...)
```

[Diagram: document foo.xhtml containing `"#{util.escape(...)}"`, a red arrow labeled "return" pointing to a box titled `type(string)` containing `#{malicious}`, and a further red arrow labeled "evaluate" leading off to the right]

--- page 72 ---

[Screenshot: a four-panel stick-figure comic overlaid on the previous slide. In the first three panels a ghost says "BOO!" to a person who does not react. In the fourth panel the caption "Double Evaluation" appears next to the ghost and the person screams "AHHHH!!!". Partially visible slide text behind the comic: "To make ... eturned", "string loo...", "http:/ ... html:", "utils", "foo.", "\"#{util.", "valuate"]

--- page 73 ---

Code reuse bug leads to Expression Language injection

We can execute partial EL in any file under servlet context but need to find a good gadget to control the return value

[Diagram: a document icon labeled with the filename below, containing the code block]

```
widgets/suggest_add_new_directory_entry_iframe.xhtml
```

```xml
<nxu:set var="directoryNameForPopup"
   value="#{request.getParameter('directoryNameForPopup')}"
   cache="true">
```

[The `#{request.getParameter('directoryNameForPopup')}` portion of the value attribute is outlined in a red box]

--- page 74 ---

EL blacklist bypassed leads to Remote Code Execution

Blacklist is always a bad idea :(

[Diagram: a document icon labeled org/jboss/seam/blacklist.properties containing the entries below; a red X marks the first code box and a green check marks the second]

```
org/jboss/seam/blacklist.properties

getClass(
class.
addRole(
getPassword(
removeRole(
```

```
"".getClass().forName("java.lang.Runtime")
```

```
""["class"].forName("java.lang.Runtime")
```

--- page 75 ---

Chain all together

1. Path normalization bug leads to ACL bypass
2. Bypass whitelist to access unauthorized Seam servlet
3. Use Seam feature `actionMethod` to invoke gadgets in a known file
4. Prepare second stage payload in `directoryNameForPopup`
5. Use array-like operators to bypass the EL blacklist
6. Write the shellcode with Java reflection API and wait for our shell back

Mitigation

- Isolate backend application
  - Remove the management console and other servlet contexts
- Check behaviors between proxy and backend servers
  - I wrote a path(just a PoC) to disable URL path parameter on both Tomcat and Jetty

--- page 85 ---

Summary

1. Inconsistency and implicit propertiy on path parsers
2. New attack surface on multi-layered architectures
3. Case studies in new CVEs and bug bounty programs
