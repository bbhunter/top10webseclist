# Collect a year's web hacking techniques

You are building `<YEAR>-ai.md`: a machine-assembled, unranked, explicitly
provisional collection of candidate research published in one calendar year.
It sits beside the hand-curated year lists and never replaces them.

Keep judging marks out of the published Markdown and website: no scores,
scorecards, score cutoffs or verdict labels, including in watchlists and exclusion
notes. They can put pressure on researchers and judges. Keep detailed scoring in
gitignored `.local/ai-evaluation/`. Public
`ai-evaluation/` records contain only candidate identity, links and Added / Not
added, with dates and merit-revision identifiers in decision history. Publish titles, source links, author credits and factual
notes about dates, scope, source availability or prior research.
For submissions, follow the judging skill's **Author clarification and submission
replies** before responding to or closing an issue or PR.

Two failure modes make a run worthless, and both are easy to fall into:

1. **Citing the wrong thing.** A news article about research is not the
   research. A roundup, a vendor advisory with no analysis, or a CVE record is
   not a technique writeup. The deliverable is the *original* source.
2. **Re-collecting what is already there.** The curated list for the year, and
   any previous run of this skill, already hold links. Re-adding them inflates
   the file and hides the genuinely new finds. This is what the exclusion step
   exists to prevent — do not skip it because the year "looks empty".

## Process

### 1. Resolve the year and build the exclusion set

Do this **first**, before any searching, so every downstream step can filter
against it.

```bash
python .claude/skills/webseclist-collect-year/scripts/known_links.py <YEAR> --raw
```

This reads `<YEAR>.md` and `<YEAR>-ai.md` (and handles the shared `2016-17.md`)
and prints every URL already recorded, normalised so that trailing slashes,
`www.`, http-vs-https, tracking parameters and Wayback wrappers do not produce
false "new" finds.

Read the private `.local/ai-evaluation/<YEAR>/` notes and the public outcome
index before repeating research. Read the existing `<YEAR>-ai.md` if there is one. Its **Watchlist** and
**Explicitly excluded** sections are the previous run's notes to you: they say
which artifacts had not been published yet and which candidates were already
chased down and rejected, with reasons. Start from those rather than
rediscovering them.

Fix the date window now and state it: 1 January to 31 December of the year, or
to today if the year is still running.

### 2. Sweep, split across beats

Read [references/source-map.md](references/source-map.md) — it lists the beats,
names the blogs that are currently productive, records which sources are
**confirmed dead** (so you do not spend a sweep on them), and documents the
API endpoints and workarounds for sources that block automated fetching.

Run the beats **in parallel as subagents**, one beat each, rather than
sequentially. A year is far too much ground for one context, and the beats are
independent. Give every subagent: the year and date window, the rules in
step 3, and an instruction to return structured lines plus a list of sources it
swept that produced nothing.

Subagents commonly exhaust their web-search budget mid-sweep. Tell them to fall
back to fetching index pages, feeds, sitemaps and the JSON APIs in the source
map, and to report explicitly which beats ended up under-covered — an honest
gap recorded in the Watchlist is worth more than a silent one.

Any file saved to disk while probing — a page fetched with `curl -o` to
inspect, a bot-wall response kept for a second look, a `candidates.txt`
working list — goes in the session scratchpad or the OS temp directory,
**never inside the repository**. A stray download at the repo root gets
committed and published with the list. Pass this rule to every subagent.

### 3. Rules every candidate must pass

- **Original source only.** The researcher's own blog post, the whitepaper, the
  full slide deck, the talk video, or the disclosed report. Never a news site
  (BleepingComputer, The Hacker News, SecurityWeek, DarkReading), never Reddit,
  Hacker News or an X thread, never a newsletter. Those are fine to *find*
  things through — chase the link back and cite the original.
- **A research contribution** under the judging skill's current Repository
  collection merit, including substantive practical explanations of earlier work.
  A new technique, attack class, primitive or meaningful extension can qualify,
  but new primitive discovery is not the only route. Exclude vendor patch announcements, plain CVE disclosures with no
  analysis, routine bug bounty writeups, product marketing, and roundups.
- **In the date window.** Verify by fetching the page; do not trust a feed's
  `<updated>` timestamp, a sitemap `lastmod`, or a search result snippet, all of
  which are known to lie. The most common error is work **disclosed the previous
  year** and merely *presented* at a conference in the target year — that
  belongs to the year of disclosure.
- **Not already recorded.** Filter candidates through the exclusion set:

  ```bash
  cat candidates.txt | python .claude/skills/webseclist-collect-year/scripts/known_links.py <YEAR> --filter --verbose
  ```

- **Grouped.** One piece of work with a blog post, slides, a video and a tool is
  **one entry** with related links, not four entries.

Apply the judging criteria from `webseclist-judge-reference` as you triage —
especially its central rule: **impact is not research value**. A CVSS 10.0 on a
famous target can teach nothing new, and an obscure parser quirk can introduce a
primitive that reshapes a class. Score the contribution, not the headline. You
do not need a full scorecard for every candidate at this stage; use the criteria
as a filter, and reach for the full skill when a call is genuinely close.

- **Selection merit:** a candidate is included only after a full private
  `webseclist-judge-reference` evaluation passes that skill's current
  **Repository collection merit**. Read it for every run; do not duplicate its
  numerical cutoff here. Scope, first-publication year and non-duplication still
  apply. Criteria may change, so an earlier outcome is not a permanent judgement.

### 4. Preserve leads privately and publish outcomes

Keep all scoring, detailed reasons, search coverage and unresolved evidence in gitignored
`.local/ai-evaluation/<YEAR>/`. Never erase a discovered candidate merely because
it was not selected. Publish `ai-evaluation/<YEAR>/README.md` with candidate
identity, source links and Added / Not added only. A lead awaiting evaluation
is Not added, but that does not mean it received a completed rejection.

For completed evaluations, use the judging skill's `history.py record` workflow,
then `history.py render --year <YEAR>` and `history.py verify`. Public
`judgements.md` contains completed inclusion outcomes; append-only `history.jsonl`
contains decision dates and merit-revision fingerprints, never scores. Use
`--event-type rejudgement` after reassessment. A changed merit revision may justify
reassessment; it must not silently rewrite earlier decisions or re-publish scores.

### 5. Verify the links

```bash
python .claude/skills/webseclist-collect-year/scripts/check_links.py <YEAR>-ai.md --only-problems
```

Read the output with judgement — the script's own docstring explains the codes.
`403` and `429` are usually anti-bot defences rather than dead links; `404` is
real and must be fixed or dropped. For a host that is down, a Wayback snapshot
is an acceptable citation **if** you say so in the entry.

### 6. Write the file

Write `<YEAR>-ai.md`. On a re-run, **merge** — keep the existing entries, add
the new ones to their sections, and update the Watchlist and exclusions rather
than starting over.

The file opens with two notices, and neither is optional. The first says a
machine assembled it; the second says it is provisional. Both exist so a reader
arriving from a search engine cannot mistake this for the curated list.

## <Theme>

-   [Title](url) [Slides](url) [Tool](url) — Author, org

… repeat per theme …

## Watchlist — in scope but no primary artifact yet

<Confirmed to exist and in-window, but slides/paper/writeup not published.
Say what you checked and what signal you used, so the next run resumes
instead of re-searching.>

## Explicitly excluded

<Recorded so the same items are not re-chased. Group by reason: published in a
different year, not a new technique, out of web scope, source unreachable.>
````

Group entries by theme, not by source or by date. Themes that have worked:
HTTP and protocol; client-side and browser; frameworks, injection and
server-side; authentication, identity and session; AI agents and MCP as web
attack surface; CI/CD and supply chain with a web mechanism; academic papers.
Adapt them to what the year actually produced — an empty section is noise.

Match the list style of the curated year files: `-   [Title](url)` with three
spaces after the dash. Wrap any URL containing parentheses in angle brackets,
`[Title](<url>)`, or the markdown link will break.

### 7. Restamp the published banner

The website prints a "PRELIMINARY - SUBJECT TO CHANGE" banner over the
collection, and the date in it comes from `website/archive-years.json`, not from
the file you just wrote. A sweep that stops at step 6 leaves the site telling
readers the leads run through the *previous* sweep's date.

So whenever a sweep adds, removes or re-dates a lead, update that year's record:

- `asOf` - the ISO date the coverage now runs through.
- `notice` - the same date spelled out, e.g. `through 18 August 2026`. State one
  date only; `refresh_web_apps.py` fails the run if it does not match `asOf`.

Then run the `webseclist-refresh-web-apps` skill to regenerate
`website/data/`. It warns when `<YEAR>-ai.md` has been committed more recently
than `asOf`, which is the symptom of a sweep that skipped this step.

The coverage date is worth keeping honest rather than dropping: on an unranked,
unvetted collection it is the one thing that tells a reader whether the absence
of some recent technique means anything.

## Handling finds from other years

A sweep for one year always surfaces work from the year before. Do not silently
drop it and do not quietly add it to a curated list.

- Record it in the **Explicitly excluded** section with its actual publication
  date, so the next run does not re-chase it.
- If it looks genuinely significant *and* is missing from that year's list, run
  the full `webseclist-judge-reference` skill on it privately. Only if it passes
  the current Repository collection merit is it a candidate for `<YEAR>.md`,
  and then it is added as a single reviewed line under "Other nominations" with
  public Added / Not added outcome under `ai-evaluation/<YEAR>/`. Keep the
  scorecard and reasons privately under `.local/ai-evaluation/<YEAR>/`.

This is the **only** circumstance in which this workflow touches a curated year
list. Never bulk-add to one.

## What this skill does not do

It collects and writes `<YEAR>-ai.md`. It does **not** rank or vote, does not
produce a top ten, does not fetch or convert sources into `archived-references/`
(that is `webseclist-archive-references`), does not snapshot nomination or
results pages (that is `webseclist-archive-listings`), and does not rewrite the
hand-curated lists `2006.md`..`2025.md` beyond the single review-gated addition
path above.
