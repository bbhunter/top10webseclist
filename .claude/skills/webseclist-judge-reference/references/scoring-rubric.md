Read this when you are unsure where a candidate lands on a category. Each category
is scored 0–100 independently; the weights only enter when `score.py` combines them.
The bands are the same everywhere: **0–19** little/none · **20–39** limited ·
**40–59** moderate · **60–79** strong · **80–100** exceptional. Score against the
*underlying contribution* you extracted, not against the impact of the demo.

A recurring trap runs through all six categories: **letting impact leak into the
score.** Each section below names the specific version of that leak to watch for.

## Original contribution (25%)

*How much genuinely new knowledge, capability, or understanding does the work add?*

Score this against **prior art that was public before the candidate's earliest
verified public disclosure**, not against your own prior ignorance or later work.
The question is whether the field could have known this when the candidate appeared,
not whether you know it now. A later publication covering the same idea cannot lower
this score or any other category. Later sources are retrieval leads only; exclude
their hindsight from the judgement.

- **0–19** — Restates or re-demonstrates a technique already well known by the
  cutoff; a new target for an established bug class with no new mechanism.
- **20–39** — Minor variation or a fresh payload for a primitive public before the
  cutoff; independent rediscovery of something already public then.
- **40–59** — A real but incremental extension, or a combination of ideas known by
  the cutoff whose novelty is modest.
- **60–79** — A new primitive, a non-obvious combination that yields a capability that
  had not been publicly described or demonstrated by the cutoff, or a materially
  deeper understanding of a known area.
- **80–100** — Introduces a new class, mechanism, or way of seeing a problem that
  reframes how others will approach it after the cutoff.

**Trap:** a critical-severity, widely-covered CVE can score *low* here if the
technique behind it is textbook. Severity is not on this axis. Conversely, a
"low-impact" quirk that introduces a reusable primitive can score high.

**Component age is not technique age.** Specifications and API documentation are
background unless they also communicate the relevant security use. Judge the
candidate's added capability or understanding under its stated constraints. An
unusual payload source or transformation can merit 60–79 when it contributes a
non-obvious reusable technique; a cosmetic spelling change to a known route may
merit 20–39. Explain which it is through a mechanism comparison, rather than
deducing modest novelty from old APIs, a short PoC, or a familiar XSS outcome.
A failed prior-art search does not establish the stronger interpretation.

**Rediscovery:** if the same idea was public before the candidate's novelty cutoff,
score novelty against that earlier work even when the candidate reached it
independently — credit the independence in the verdict and confidence, not in this
number. Work first published after the cutoff is not prior art.

## Transferability (20%)

*Can the underlying contribution apply beyond the exact reported target or environment?*

You already stripped the target-specific detail in step 1; score what remains.

- **0–19** — Bound to one product, version, or configuration; nothing generalises.
- **20–39** — Might apply to a couple of close cousins, with significant caveats.
- **40–59** — Applies across a family (one framework's ecosystem, one protocol
  feature) given similar preconditions.
- **60–79** — Applies across many technologies that share a mechanism, not just a
  vendor.
- **80–100** — A cross-cutting insight that recurs wherever the underlying assumption
  holds (a parsing model, an encoding step, a trust boundary).

**Trap (both directions):** "product-specific" is not automatically low — a bug in
one CMS may turn on a language-level footgun every app in that language shares. And
"affects thousands of sites" is not automatically high — that can be the reach of a
single well-known misconfiguration, i.e. coverage, not transferable insight.

## Lasting value (20%)

*At publication, what potential did it offer for future research, testing, tooling, or methodology?*

- **0–19** — A point-in-time fix; nothing to carry forward once patched.
- **20–39** — Useful now, little reason to cite it in a year.
- **40–59** — A solid datapoint others may reference occasionally.
- **60–79** — Likely to be built on, cited, or folded into testing methodology.
- **80–100** — Offers a well-supported potential to reshape how a class of problems
  is tested or reasoned about for years; subsequent adoption is not required.

Assess old and new work identically, using only the original disclosure and
pre-cutoff knowledge. Later citations, adoption, rediscovery, neglect, fixes, or
obsolescence cannot affect this score. A useful idea may remain overlooked. Judge
the technical opportunities available at publication, not whether anyone later
pursued them. Neither later success nor later silence is evidence in this evaluation.

Look for a reusable testing
rule, payload-generation method, or insight grounded in persistent platform
behaviour. Standards, implementation evidence, and compatibility constraints can
support a forecast that the primitive will remain useful. Explain that evidence
and the remaining conditions; a researcher's claim that browsers will never patch
it is not a verified guarantee. Persistent behaviour supports lasting value only
when the candidate adds something useful to carry forward. A filter can block a
particular vector while the underlying testing insight remains useful.

## Technical soundness (15%)

*Are the reasoning, evidence, and conclusions technically convincing?*

- **0–19** — Claims unsupported, mechanism hand-waved, or demonstrably wrong.
- **20–39** — Plausible but thinly evidenced; gaps in the causal chain.
- **40–59** — Mostly sound with some unverified leaps.
- **60–79** — Well-reasoned, evidence matches the claims, limitations acknowledged.
- **80–100** — Rigorous: mechanism explained, claims proven, scope and failure modes
  honest.

Judge the **argument**, not the prose polish or the platform it was published on. A
rough writeup with a correct, well-evidenced mechanism outscores a slick one that
asserts more than it shows.

Separate the demonstrated primitive from broader claims about every browser,
production exploitability, or WAF bypasses. An untested broad claim warrants a
qualification and, where material, a soundness deduction; it does not erase a
well-supported narrower result. Not running a supplied PoC yourself is a limit on
your verification, not evidence that the source lacks reproducible detail.

Assess the reasoning and evidence available at publication. Exclude later
replications, critiques, and corrections from this historical score; inability to
run a historical PoC on a current platform does not refute its original evidence.

## Practical usability (10%)

*Can others use the contribution in useful security work or further research?*

- **0–19** — Not actionable; needs conditions no one realistically has.
- **20–39** — Usable only in narrow, contrived setups.
- **40–59** — Usable with real but surmountable effort or preconditions.
- **60–79** — Readily applicable in normal testing or research.
- **80–100** — Immediately actionable and broadly applicable; lowers the bar for
  everyone after.

Tooling and methodology contributions often score high here even when Original
contribution is moderate — making an existing idea *usable at scale* is itself value.

A runnable primitive or useful corpus addition can be actionable for research
without a named vulnerable application or WAF. Score its actual preconditions and
testing utility. If its claimed contribution is defeating a filter, assess the
evidence for that bypass separately: execution with filtering absent does not
demonstrate it. Requiring an executable handler can limit applicability without
settling whether the payload source is new or the testing insight is durable.

## Clarity and reproducibility (10%)

*Is there enough information to understand, verify, or reproduce the work?*

- **0–19** — Vague teaser; no steps, no detail to reproduce.
- **20–39** — Gist conveyed, key steps missing.
- **40–59** — Reproducible with effort and some gap-filling.
- **60–79** — Clear, with steps/PoC/enough detail to follow.
- **80–100** — Fully reproducible: precise steps, code or PoC, preconditions stated.

This scores the *evidence available to a reader*, which is distinct from confidence.
Confidence is about *your* certainty in the verdict; clarity is about *the source's*
completeness. A perfectly clear writeup of a duplicate still scores well here — and
still gets a "duplicate" verdict.

### Substantive explanations of earlier work

Score added practical understanding independently from priority. A detailed
explanation of a terse earlier technique can earn strong Transferability, Lasting
value or Practical usability scores when it shows readers where to test, what
conditions matter and which fixes fail. Compare that instructional contribution
with available pre-cutoff explanations; do not award it merely for longer prose,
more attention or an example missing from this archive. Keep Original contribution
grounded in what is actually new, and keep unverified examples separate from
demonstrated results. Repository collection eligibility is defined in SKILL.md.

## Worked mini-examples

These illustrate the impact-vs-novelty split; they are calibration aids, not quotas.

- **Textbook bug, huge target.** SQL injection on a major site via a standard union
  payload, no new mechanism. Original ~10, Transferability ~15, Lasting ~10, even
  though the impact and press were enormous. The technique is decades old.

- **Small quirk, new primitive.** A parser discrepancy in how one library handles a
  delimiter, shown to enable request smuggling in a way not described before the
  candidate's cutoff. Original ~75, Transferability ~70, Lasting ~70 — the target is
  narrow but the primitive generalises and others will hunt for it elsewhere.

- **Strong combination.** Chaining two behaviours known before the cutoff (say a
  client-side path traversal plus a CSRF sink) into a reliable account-takeover
  pattern nobody had assembled by then. Do not anchor on "both parts were known" —
  score the new capability. A non-obvious reusable pattern can earn Original
  60–79; a modest incremental combination belongs at 40–59. Transferability and
  Lasting can be high if the pattern recurs.

- **Tooling over known ideas.** A fuzzer that automates discovery of a discrepancy
  class public before the cutoff. Original may be ~40, but Practical usability and
  Lasting value can be high because it scales what was previously manual.

- **Independent rediscovery.** A clearly-written technique that a paper publicly
  described two years before the candidate's cutoff. Original scored against that
  prior work (~25–35), verdict "independent rediscovery," confidence set by how
  firmly you established precedence — and the independence noted in the reasoning,
  not added to the number. If the equivalent paper appeared two years *after* the
  candidate, it cannot affect any category; use it only to locate actual pre-cutoff evidence.
