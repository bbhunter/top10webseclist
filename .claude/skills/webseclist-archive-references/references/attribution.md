# Naming the researcher

Extraction records an author only where the page DECLARES one, in a meta tag,
`article:author`, `dc.creator` or JSON-LD. Most pages do not: 1,254 of 1,684
references once published as "Author not stated" while the byline sat in the
first lines of the document, and the credit line fell back to the hostname. That
is wrong twice over - it credits a domain rather than a person, and where the
domain has since been taken over it credits the squatter.

The byline is therefore READ OUT OF THE ARCHIVED TEXT, by an agent, one document
at a time:

```text
python tools/references/refs.py bylines --queue work/bylines.json     # offline
#   ... reference-attributor reads each excerpt, one per invocation ...
python tools/references/refs.py bylines --apply work/reviewed.json    # offline
python tools/references/refs.py attribution                           # offline
#   ... then re-render, as any stated attribution needs ...
```

`--queue` writes every reference with no author beside the text to read it from.
The excerpt deliberately starts AFTER our own frontmatter, heading and
attribution block: hand a reader our "Author not stated" line and they will
report back what we already believe. Links are collapsed to their text, so a
name arrives without a URL beside it.

`--apply` records what clears the bar in `bylines.json` and refuses the rest. A
name is taken only when the reference exists, the reviewer is confident, and it
quoted the words the name was read from. **A wrong name is worse than no name**:
an unattributed reference says the archive does not know, a misattributed one
credits a stranger with someone's work and reads as fact. An entry naming nobody
is kept too, so the next run does not ask the same question again.

`--accept medium` widens it, and "medium" is not a synonym for "doubtful": it is
what a reviewer says when the byline is real but sits somewhere other than under
the title - a site-wide footer ("Wisec is written and mantained by Stefano Di
Paola"), a signature, a handle an author has published under for twenty years.
Taking those is a curation call, which is why it is spelled on the command line.

**ATTRIBUTION MUST NEVER DECIDE WHETHER A DOCUMENT IS KEPT.** `grade.classify`
reads an override as a whole judgement and defaults a missing `outcome` to
`skip`, so an entry carrying only `authors` once told the grader to keep no
document at all - 214 research references lost their grade in a single run. The
grader now ignores an override that says nothing about keeping the document, and
`refs.attribution_decision` returns only `authors` and `publisher`. Re-render
runs should still watch the count of `grade: null` entries and stop if it rises.

`bylines.json` is generated and always loses to `overrides.json`, where a
maintainer states an author by hand. Withdraw a wrong credit there with
`"authors": []`; see the `attribution` notes in `tools/references/README.md`.

Expect several authors. A conference paper has six and keeping the first two is
the same failure in a smaller costume.
